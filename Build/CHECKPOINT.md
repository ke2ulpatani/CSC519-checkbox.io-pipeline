# Checkpoint 1
## Planning
We planned on how to achieve the objective of this milestone and divided the tasks amongst ourselves by creating different stories on GitHub Project Board for this [milestone](https://github.ncsu.edu/cscdevops-spring2020/DEVOPS-10/projects/2). Each story is created such that it can be performed independently.

## Goals Achieved
We have created the build job for iTrust using Ansible which currently clones the GitHub repo(Manually created GH_USER and GH_PASS). We are also working on feedback from Milestone 1. We have also started working on creating automated code fuzzer.
