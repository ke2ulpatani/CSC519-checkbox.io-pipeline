# Checkpoint 1
## Planning
We had a planning session on how to goforth with this milestone, and discussed the monitoring and canary part in detail. We again divided the tasks amongst us and made sure we keep them independent of other tasks on our Github Project [deploy](https://github.ncsu.edu/cscdevops-spring2020/DEVOPS-10/projects/3).
