# Checkpoint 1
## Planning
We planned on how to achieve the objective of this milestone and Further, divided the tasks amongst ourselves such there's no story blocking other story in the storyboard.
## Goals Achieved
We created node project skeleton from CM-Template. After that we implemented `pipeline build` command which currently issues jenkins-srv server with specific ip-address and install Jenkins and it's dependencies on it.
